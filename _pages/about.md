I am a Ph.D. candidate in Business Economics at the <a href="https://www.insper.edu.br/en/home" style="text-decoration:none">Insper Institute of Education and Research</a> in São Paulo, Brazil. I was a Visiting Research Scholar at Northwestern University, invited by <a href = "https://sites.northwestern.edu/iac879/" style="text-decoration:none">Ivan Canay</a>, with a FAPESP Fellowship. 

My research interests are theoretical and applied econometrics. Currently, I focus on discontinuity-based estimators.

Beyond academia
-------------------
I am originally from Londrina and earned my B.A. in Economics from <a href="https://www.epge.fgv.br/en" style="text-decoration:none">FGV/EPGE</a> in Rio de Janeiro. I love learning languages (and that includes programming). In addition to Portuguese and English, I studied Spanish for many years and am currently learning Italian. I also spent a year in Finland as a high school exchange student, which gave me a basic understanding of Finnish.

I also watch a lot of sports (though I don't practice any) and have practiced yoga for many years.
