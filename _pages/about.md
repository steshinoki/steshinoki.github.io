I am a PhD candidate in Business Economics at the <a href="https://www.insper.edu.br/en/home" style="text-decoration:none">Insper Institute of Education and Research</a> in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm currently a Visiting Research Scholar at Northwestern University, invited by <a href = "https://sites.northwestern.edu/iac879/" style="text-decoration:none">Ivan Canay</a>, with a <a href="https://fapesp.br/en" style="text-decoration:none">FAPESP</a> Fellowship. 

My research interest are theoretical and applied econometrics. Currently, I focus on discontinuity-based estimators.

Beyond academia
-------------------
I am originally from Londrina and earned my B.A. in Economics from <a href="https://www.epge.fgv.br/en" style="text-decoration:none">FGV/EPGE</a> in Rio de Janeiro. I love understanding languages (and that includes programming). Besides Portuguese and English, I studied Spanish for many years - although it has been some time since I last studied it - and I am actively learning Italian. I did a high school exchange in Finland which gave me a basic undestanding of Finnish.

I also watch a lot of sports and you will regularly find me watching competitions of a wide range of events. While I don't actively practice any, I do yoga regularly and have done so for many years.
