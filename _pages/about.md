I am a PhD candidate in Business Economics at the <u><a href="https://www.insper.edu.br/en/">Insper Institute of Education and Research</a></u> in São Paulo, Brazil. My research interest are econometrics, with an emphasis on identification and inference.

I am originally from Londrina, Brazil, and prior to graduate school, I earned my B.A. in Economics from FGV/EPGE in Rio de Janeiro.

Beyond the academia:
-------------------
I love understanding languages (and that includes programming). Besides Portuguese and English, I studied Spanish for many years, although it has been some time since I last studied it, and I am actively learning Italian. I did a high school exchange in Finland which gave me a basic undestanding of finnish.

I also love watching sports and you will regularly find me watching competitions of a wide range of events. While I don't actively practice any, I do yoga regularly and have done so for many years.
